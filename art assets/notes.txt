My first approach was:
	something like a fantasy warrior by design?
	incorporate both nature and technology?
	maybe artificial parts that incorporate part-switching with a buster

I opted on not having a buster as I thought having a gun would be cooler.
I also tried to design some interesting guns to go along with the design, but they're mostly open to interpretation.
Went with a raggedy cape (or cloak) to show battle and travel wear (also because I think it looks cool).
Goggles/shades to help with shooting and so nothing weird gets into the eyes.

Initially I was just designing something, I thought of designing two other designs, one of which involved a cuter route with the character (probably a cat)
riding a mecha that would have an open cockpit.
The other one was someone older with an eyepatch and a bigger gun. Think of someone like Guts from Berserk but if he had a gun.

Possible ideas for upgrades or level-ups include maybe stronger parts, which means a stronger robot body, or just a stronger bigger gun?
Having a robot armor or something like that was also something I was thinking of.
